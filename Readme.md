# K-nearest-neighbors

#### K-nearest-neighbors:
+ Initialize k nearest neighbors and p to calculate a distance by using norm.
+ Load data, label and store it
+ With each input vector. We calculate the distance of this vector and each vector in the data. After that, They are put into a new list and sorted in ascending order.
+ Get k elements from the sorted list and find the most label in them.
+ Return the label of the input vector.
